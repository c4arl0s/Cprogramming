Description

The C library function char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream) reads a line from the specified stream and stores it into the string pointed to by str. It stops when either (n-1) characters are read, the newline character is read, or the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first.

Declaration

Following is the declaration for fgets() function.

char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)

Parameters

str -- This is the pointer to an array of chars where the string read is stored.

n -- This is the maximum number of characters to be read (including the final null-character). Usually, the length of the array passed as str is used.

stream -- This is the pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream where characters are read from.

Return Value

On success, the function returns the same str parameter. If the End-of-File is encountered and no characters have been read, the contents of str remain unchanged and a null pointer is returned.

If an error occurs, a null pointer is returned.
