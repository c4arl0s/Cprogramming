Please tell how scanf() returns values, based on the argument:
int g;
int p=scanf("%d",g);

From the man page:
NAME
       scanf,  fscanf, sscanf, vscanf, vsscanf, vfscanf 
              ...
              RETURN VALUE
These functions return the number of input items  successfully  matched
and assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even zero in the
event of an early matching failure.

The value EOF is returned if the end of input is reached before  either
the  first  successful conversion or a matching failure occurs.  EOF is
also returned if a read error occurs, in which case the error indicator
for  the  stream  (see ferror(3)) is set, and errno is set indicate the
error.

In your case, scanf() can return 0, 1 or EOF.
